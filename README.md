# MathQuest

MathQuest is an educational game built with Unity. It plays like a classic RPG (Final Fantasy) type of game and is designed to help children learn basic math skills. This repository holds the code that was used in the game. If you would like to try the game itself please sent me an e-mail at hovanitz.hans@gmail.com
